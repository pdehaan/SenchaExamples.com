# Marking a field as required on an Ext.field.Text control in Sencha Touch 2 #

The following example shows how you can set an Ext.field.Field control [in this case an Ext.field.Text (textfield) control], as required in Sencha Touch by setting the Boolean `required` config option or by calling the `setRequired()` method at runtime.

*Note:* Setting the `required` config option only causes a visual indication. It does not prevent the user from submitting the form.
